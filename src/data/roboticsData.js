      "Over the course of two years, I rebuilt McGill's Autonomous Underwater Vehicle team from a directionless group of five students into an engineering powerhouse with over 50 members and two fully autonomous robots.",
      "From architecting the autonomous systems to pursuing sponsorships and fundraising, I've poured my heart and soul into the success of this team. When I became project manager in 2021, I had a vision to turn McGill Robotics into an organization that not only develops cutting-edge technology, but exceptional engineers as well. I believe the leadership experience, deep technological know-how, and product development knowledge I gained from this team far exceed anything I've learned at school.",
